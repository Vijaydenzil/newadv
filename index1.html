            Whether or not this new route on Everest is one that will impact the future of the mountain remains to be seen. But, it is clear that the Khumbu continues to grow more perilous. The icefall has always been dangerous, but due to warming temperatures and melting ice, its shifting seracs are becoming increasingly less stable, making it more dangerous for climbers to pass through.

            The route is maintained each year by a special group of Sherpas known as the “Ice Doctors.” They scout and build a trail through the icefall by installing fixed ropes and placing ladders both horizontally and vertically across open crevasses. The trail changes from year to year and often has to be rebuilt several times each season as the towers of ice collapse. Because of this, the Khumbu is usually seen as the most dangerous place on Everest, even though it sits more than 3000 meters (9842 feet) below the summit</p1>

          <p2>Adventure tourism is a new concept in the tourism industry. Tourism industry adopted adventure tourism, but there is not any specific definition of adventure tourism. Most commentators concur that adventure tourism is a niche sector of the tourism industry, but there are many other niche sectors in tourism which have same characteristics that overlap with adventure tourism such as ecotourism, activity tourism or adventure travel.Adventure tourists may have the motivation to achieve mental states characterized as rush or flow,resulting from stepping outside their comfort zone. This may be from experiencing culture shock or by performing acts requiring significant effort and involve some degree of risk, real or perceived, or physical danger. This may include activities such as mountaineering, trekking, bungee jumping, mountain biking, cycling, canoeing, scuba diving, rafting, kayaking, zip-lining, paragliding, hiking, exploring, canyoneering, sandboarding, caving and rock climbing.Some obscure forms of adventure travel include disaster and ghetto tourism.Other rising forms of adventure travel include social and jungle tourism.

            Access to inexpensive consumer technology, with respect to Global Positioning Systems, flashpacking, social networking and photography, have increased the worldwide interest in adventure travel.
             The interest in independent adventure travel has also increased as more specialist travel websites emerge offering previously niche locations and sports.</p2>

               <P4>While the presence of danger may repel most people, those with an adventurous bent seem inexorably drawn toward dangerous activities. Whether it’s the enjoyment of the sport itself or purely the thrill of doing something that the majority of the population views as off-limits, something seems to bring certain people back to freezing mountainsides, deep waters, and sheer cliff faces again and again.

To the average person, an adventure consists of going somewhere new or enjoying an activity that we’ve never done before. But for others, an adventure isn’t an adventure unless there’s an element of danger involved. The following eight adventure activities are inherently dangerous, but the likelihood of experiencing an accident while performing one of these activities can sometimes be further enhanced by the carelessness of another person or corporation.

If you wish to avoid sustaining an injury, it’s probably best to stay away from these activities altogether. But if you’ve already been hurt by an adventure gone wrong, it’s important to know that you’re not alone and that help is available to make things right.</P4>
